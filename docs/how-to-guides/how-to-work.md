# How to work on this project

Before committing your changes, make sure you are working on the latest codebase by fetching or pulling to make sure you have all the work.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

To initiate a build:

 1. Create a branch specific to the feature.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

 2. Make the required changes and commit

    ```bash
    git commit -m "commit-message"
    ```

 3. Push the changes

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
