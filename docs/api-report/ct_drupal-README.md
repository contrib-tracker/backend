# Drupal.org Contribution Tracker

## Description

The Drupal.org Contribution Tracker is a module designed to track and analyze the contributions of users on Drupal.org. It provides insights into user activity, such as issue comments, patch submissions, and project maintainership, allowing for a comprehensive view of their involvement in the Drupal community.

## Installation

1. Download the module to your Drupal installation's modules directory (e.g., `/modules/contrib`).
2. Enable the module via the Drupal administration interface (`/admin/modules`). You can use Drush: `drush en drupalorg_contribution_tracker`
3. Configure the module settings as required (see Configuration section).

## Usage

After installation, the module begins tracking user contributions based on the configured settings.  Usage patterns will depend heavily on the specific configuration chosen (see the Configuration section).

## Configuration

Configuration options are available through the Drupal administration interface. Navigate to the module configuration page (path provided after enabling or via `admin/config` if a UI is added for configuration ).

Key configuration areas may include:

*   **User Mapping:** Settings to map Drupal users to their Drupal.org accounts, potentially using the `do_username` module.
*   **Tracking Scope:** Define the types of contributions to track (e.g., issue comments, code patches).
*   **Reporting Frequency:** Schedule how often contribution data is updated.
*   **Notification Settings:** Configure alerts or reports, potentially utilizing the `slack` module, on significant user contributions.

## API

This module provides the following services.

### Services

*   `services`:  This service provides methods for retrieving and processing contribution data for Drupal.org users.  Further details on the API service should be found in the code within the `src/Service` directory.

## Examples

Practical examples of how to use the module:

*   **Track a specific user's contributions:**

   ```php
   // Example (Illustrative - this may not be exactly how it works)
   $user_id = 123; // Drupal User ID
   $contribution_data = \Drupal::service('services')->getUserContributions($user_id);

   // Process the contribution data to display on a custom report or page.
   ```

*   **Generate a report of top contributors:**

   ```php
   // Example (Illustrative - this may not be exactly how it works)
   $top_contributors = \Drupal::service('services')->getTopContributors(10);

   // Display the names and contribution scores of the top 10 contributors.
   ```

**Note:** These examples are for illustrative purposes only. The specifics of interacting with services will depend on the underlying code implementation. Consult the module's code for concrete implementation details.

## Dependencies

This module relies on the following Drupal modules and third-party libraries:

*   **hussainweb/drupal-api-client:** Used for interacting with the Drupal.org API.
*   **drupal/do_username:** Used for linking Drupal user accounts with Drupal.org usernames.
