# Contrib Tracker

## Description

The Contrib Tracker module is designed to track contributions from Drupal.org users. It provides a mechanism to collect and display data related to individual contributions within the Drupal ecosystem.

## Installation

1.  Download the module from [Drupal.org](insert link to project page).
2.  Place the module in your Drupal installation's `modules` directory (e.g., `/modules/contrib`).
3.  Enable the module by navigating to the "Extend" page in your Drupal administration interface (`/admin/modules`).  Search for "Contrib Tracker" and check the box to enable it.
4.  Click "Install" to complete the installation process.

## Usage

After installation, the module provides services that can be used by other modules or custom code. See the "API" section for more details on available services.

## Configuration

This module does not have a user interface for configuration. Its functionality is primarily accessed through its provided services. Any configuration would typically be done via code or through integrating modules that interact with Contrib Tracker's API.

## API

### Services

The Contrib Tracker module exposes the following services:

*   **services:**  (Detailed information of services to be added.)
    *   [Service Name 1]: Description of what this service does, its parameters, and return values.
    *   [Service Name 2]: Description of what this service does, its parameters, and return values.
    *   (Add more services as applicable)

**Example Usage (hypothetical, replace with actual service usage):**

```php
  // Example of using a Contrib Tracker service (Replace with actual service name)
  $contrib_tracker_service = \Drupal::service('contrib_tracker.example_service');
  $result = $contrib_tracker_service->doSomething('username');
  \Drupal::logger('contrib_tracker')->notice('Contrib Tracker Service Result: @result', ['@result' => $result]);
```

## Examples

Because this module is service-oriented, examples typically involve interacting with the provided services from within custom Drupal modules or Drush scripts.  Here are some abstract example scenarios:

*   **Fetching User Contributions:**  A module might use the `contrib_tracker.user_contribution_service` to retrieve a list of a specific user's contributions on Drupal.org.
*   **Displaying Contribution Statistics:** A custom block can use the module's services to display aggregated contribution statistics (e.g., total patches, contributed modules) on a website.
*   **Automated Reporting:**  A Drush command could leverage the services to generate regular reports about community contributions.

(Replace these with actual, specific examples when the module's capabilities become defined.)
