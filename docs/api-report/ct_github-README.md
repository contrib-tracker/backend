# Github Contribution Tracker

## Description

This module tracks the contributions of users on GitHub. It leverages the GitHub API to gather data and provide insights into user activity.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  Install dependencies using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  Configure the necessary environment variables (see Configuration).

## Usage

After installation, you can use the provided services to interact with the GitHub API and retrieve contribution data. See the `Examples` section for usage demonstrations.

## Configuration

This module requires a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).  The token needs `read:org` permissions if you intend to access private organizations.

Set the following environment variables:

*   `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token.

Example `.env` configuration:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here
```

## API

### Services

The module offers the following services:

*   **`services`**:  This endpoint gives you access to pre-defined functions which use the GitHub API.
  * To use this API, import the service and inject the `GITHUB_TOKEN` as an environment variable.
  * Example code:
    ```php
    use ExampleNameSpace\GithubService;

    $service = new GithubService($_ENV['GITHUB_TOKEN']);
    $userContributions = $service->getUserContributions('github_username');
    ```
    This function will retrieve public contribution events for the specific user.

### Routes

No routes are currently defined in this module. All interactions are handled through the provided services.

### Permissions

No specific permissions are defined within the module itself. However, ensure your GitHub personal access token has the necessary permissions for the data you intend to access (e.g., `read:org` for private organization data).

### Database Schema

Currently, this module does not utilize a database. Data is retrieved directly from the GitHub API.

## Examples

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Load environment variables (using Dotenv for example)
$dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
$dotenv->load();

use Github\Client;

try {
  $client = new Client();
  $client->authenticate($_ENV['GITHUB_TOKEN'], null, Client::AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN);
  $username = 'octocat'; // Replace with the GitHub username you wish to query.
  $events = $client->api('user')->events($username);
  print_r($events);
} catch (Exception $e) {
  echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
}
```

## Dependencies

*   [knplabs/github-api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api):  A PHP client library for the GitHub API.  This dependency is managed through Composer.

## Known Issues

*   Rate limiting: The GitHub API is subject to rate limits. Handle rate limit responses appropriately (e.g., by implementing retry mechanisms or caching).
*   Error handling:  Comprehensive error handling is essential to gracefully manage potential API errors (e.g., invalid tokens, network issues, resource not found).
