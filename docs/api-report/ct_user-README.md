# Contrib Tracker Users Module

**Description:** This module handles user-related processing within the Contrib Tracker system. It provides services and routes to manage user interactions and data.

## Installation

To install the Contrib Tracker Users module, follow these steps:

1.  Place the `ct_user` directory in your Drupal installation's `modules/contrib` directory (or another appropriate modules directory).

    ```bash
    mkdir -p modules/contrib
    mv ct_user modules/contrib/
    ```

2.  Enable the module via the Drupal administration interface: Navigate to `Extend` (/admin/modules) and find the "Contrib Tracker Users" module. Check the box next to it and click "Install".

3.  Alternatively, enable the module using Drush:

    ```bash
    drush en ct_user
    ```

4.  Clear the Drupal cache. This is essential after installing or uninstalling modules.

    ```bash
    drush cr
    ```

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, the Contrib Tracker Users module provides core functionality for user management within the Contrib Tracker application. Its usage is primarily dictated by the system's internal operations or specific modules that rely on it. Direct user interaction will typically be through other components of Contrib Tracker which leverage this module's functionalities. Refer to the dependent module's documentation for more detailed usage examples.

## Configuration

This module does not have a dedicated configuration page within the Drupal administration interface. Its behavior is configured through the module's code and interactions with other Contrib Tracker modules. Examine the `ct_user.routing.yml` and services the module provides to understand configurations. Consult the documentation of any modules that depend on `ct_user` for application-specific configurations.

## API

The Contrib Tracker Users module provides the following API components:

### Services

The module exposes the following services:

-   `ct_user.user_manager`:  A service for managing user profiles and data. This service provides methods to load, create, update, and delete user profiles.  Other modules can inject this service to interact with user data.
-   `ct_user.authentication`: A service for handling user authentication within the Contrib Tracker system.  This service provides methods for verifying user credentials, generating authentication tokens, and managing sessions. Other modules can use this service to authenticate users within their specific contexts.
-  `ct_user.permission_checker`: A service for checking user permissions related to Contrib Tracker specific actions. This can be injected into other modules to determine access levels.

### Routes

The module defines routes in `ct_user.routing.yml`. These routes are for internal system operations and API endpoints related to user management.

-   `/api/users/{id}` (GET): Fetches user data by ID. Requires the 'access content' permission. Returns a JSON representation of the user object.
    -  **Parameters:**
        -   `id`: (integer) The ID of the user to retrieve.
-   `/api/users` (POST): Creates a new user. Requires the 'administer users' permission. Accepts a JSON payload with user data.
    -  **Parameters (in request body):**
        -   `username`: (string, required) The username for the new user.
        -   `email`: (string, required) The email address for the new user.
        -   `password`: (string, required) The user's password.
-    `/api/users/{id}` (PATCH): Updates an existing user. Requires the 'administer users' permission or access to edit their own profile.  Accepts a JSON payload with user data.
     -  **Parameters:**
        -   `id`: (integer) The ID of the user to update.

## Examples

Since direct user interaction with this module is usually limited, examples will show how another module interacts with a `ct_user` service.

```php
// Example: Using the user_manager service to load a user's profile.
$user_id = 123; // Example user ID.  Retrieve this value from another source.
$user_profile = \Drupal::service('ct_user.user_manager')->load($user_id);

if ($user_profile) {
  // Access user profile data (assuming user implements UserInterface).
  $username = $user_profile->getAccountName();
  $email = $user_profile->getEmail();

  \Drupal::logger('my_module')->info('User ' . $username . ' loaded successfully');
} else {
  \Drupal::logger('my_module')->error('User with ID ' . $user_id . ' not found.');
}
```

```php
// Example: Check if a user has special Contrib Tracker permissions.
$user = \Drupal::currentUser(); // Or load a specific user
$permission_checker = \Drupal::service('ct_user.permission_checker');

if ($permission_checker->hasContribAdminPermissions($user)) {
    \Drupal::logger('my_module')->info('User has Contrib Admin permissions.');
} else {
    \Drupal::logger('my_module')->info('User does not have Contrib Admin permissions.');
}

```

## Dependencies

This module has the following dependencies:

*   Drupal Core: `[drupal:system (>=9.0)]` as it uses core services and APIs.
*   There are no other module dependencies within the Contrib Tracker ecosystem at this time.

## Known Issues

*   **Issue 1:** User profile update API endpoint does not currently perform robust input validation.  Malicious input can lead to data inconsistencies. Implement client-side and server-side validation checks.
*   **Issue 2:** The authentication service does not yet support multi-factor authentication.
